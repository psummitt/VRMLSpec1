# VRMLSpec1
----
This repository is an updated copy of a Web site I created in the late 1990s early 2000s that was based on chapter 7 of a book my wife and I wrote titled <em>Creating Cool 3D Web Worlds with VRML</em> (IDG, 1995).  Recently, I found the original Web site files and decided to add CSS and bootstrap and update the site.  The information has not been updated.  This is still VRML Specification 1.0.  I just though it might be interesting to some to see part of the history of Virtual Reality Modeling Language.
